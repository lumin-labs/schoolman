<!-- 
There is no difference between this and myclasses-simple except for the 
navtabs, and those are loaded dynamically on their own. This view exists solely
for maintaining the convention that all views are dynamically loaded by
combining the page name with the view name 

TODO: I dont like this convention, get rid of it
